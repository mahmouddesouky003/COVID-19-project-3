                        <h2>COVID-19 is a new illness that can affect your lungs and airways.</h2>
                        <p>It's caused by a virus called coronavirus. It was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan,
                            Hubei, China</p>
                        <p>Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and
                            breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute
                            respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.</p>

                        <p>Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering
                            mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close

                                            On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official
                                            name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak,
                                            first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus
                                            disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for
                                            ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was

                                            A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously
                                            identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not
                                            the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause
                                            mild illness, like the common cold.

                                            People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who
                                            are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are
                                            worried about the disease. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for
                                            example, towards Chinese or other Asian Americans or people who were in
                                            quarantine.
                                            Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place,
                                            or a nation. Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how
                                            COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death,
                                            and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.
                                            Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards ordinary people
                                            instead of the disease that is causing the problem.

                                            Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people,
                                            and others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals.
                                            Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect
                                            people and can spread between people. This is suspected to have occurred for
                                            the virus that causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and
                                            Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of
                                            coronaviruses that originated from animals and then spread to people. More
                                            information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the

                                            This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The
                                            first infections were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now
                                            spreading from person-to-person. It’s important to note that
                                            person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are highly
                                            contagious (like measles), while other viruses are less so.

                                            The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably
                                            in the community (“community spread”) in some affected geographic areas.
                                            Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area,
                                            including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.

                                            The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person. Someone
                                            who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others. That is
                                            why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or
                                            at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer
                                            pose a risk of infecting others.

                                            How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to
                                            release someone from isolation is made on a case-by-case basis in
                                            consultation with doctors, infection prevention and control experts, and
                                            public health officials and involves considering specifics of each situation
                                            including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of
                                            laboratory testing for that patient.

                                            Current CDC guidance for when it is OK to release someone from isolation is
                                            made on a case by case basis and includes meeting all of the following
                                            requirements:

                                            The patient is free from fever without the use of fever-reducing
                                            medications.

                                            The patient is no longer showing symptoms, including cough.

                                            The patient has tested negative on at least two consecutive respiratory
                                            specimens collected at least 24 hours apart.

                                            Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a
                                            risk of infection to others.

                                            Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person
                                            through respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support
                                            transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating
                                            food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20
                                            seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after
                                            blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.

                                            It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or
                                            object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or
                                            possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus
                                            spreads.

                                            In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on
                                            surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or
                                            packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient,
                                            refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.

                                            Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on
                                            the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority.
                                            Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have
                                            seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded
                                            in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is
                                            unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.

                                            You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by
                                            taking some simple precautions:

                                            Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or
                                            wash them with soap and water.

                                            Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub
                                            kills viruses that may be on your hands.


                                            Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who
                                            is coughing or sneezing.

                                            Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from
                                            their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can
                                            breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing
                                            has the disease.


                                            Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.

                                            Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated,
                                            hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the
                                            virus can enter your body and can make you sick.


                                            Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.
                                            This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when
                                            you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.

                                            Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you
                                            protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.


                                            Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty
                                            breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions
                                            of your local health authority.

                                            Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date
                                            information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow
                                            your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health
                                            facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and
                                            other infections.


                                            Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where
                                            COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places –
                                            especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung
                                            disease.

                                            Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.

                                            laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or a person under investigation. Close
                                            contacts should monitor their health; they should call their healthcare
                                            provider right away if they develop symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (e.g.,
                                            fever, cough, shortness of breath)

                                            Close contacts should also follow these recommendations:

                                            Make sure that you understand and can help the patient follow their
                                            healthcare provider’s instructions for medication(s) and care. You should
                                            help the patient with basic needs in the home and provide support for
                                            getting groceries, prescriptions, and other personal needs.


                                            Monitor the patient’s symptoms. If the patient is getting sicker, call his
                                            or her healthcare provider and tell them that the patient has
                                            laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This will help the healthcare provider’s
                                            office take steps to keep other people in the office or waiting room from
                                            getting infected. Ask the healthcare provider to call the local or state
                                            health department for additional guidance. If the patient has a medical
                                            emergency and you need to call 911, notify the dispatch personnel that the
                                            patient has, or is being evaluated for COVID-19.


                                            Household members should stay in another room or be separated from the
                                            patient as much as possible. Household members should use a separate bedroom
                                            and bathroom, if available.


                                            Prohibit visitors who do not have an essential need to be in the home.


                                            Household members should care for any pets in the home. Do not handle pets
                                            or other animals while sick. For more information, see COVID-19 and Animals.


                                            Make sure that shared spaces in the home have good air flow, such as by an
                                            air conditioner or an opened window, weather permitting.


                                            Perform hand hygiene frequently. Wash your hands often with soap and water
                                            for at least 20 seconds or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains
                                            60 to 95% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them
                                            together until they feel dry. Soap and water should be used preferentially
                                            if hands are visibly dirty.


                                            Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.


                                            The patient should wear a facemask when you are around other people. If the
                                            patient is not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes
                                            trouble breathing), you, as the caregiver, should wear a mask when you are
                                            in the same room as the patient.


                                            Wear a disposable facemask and gloves when you touch or have contact with
                                            the patient’s blood, stool, or body fluids, such as saliva, sputum, nasal
                                            mucus, vomit, urine.

                                            Throw out disposable facemasks and gloves after using them. Do not reuse.


                                            When removing personal protective equipment, first remove and dispose of
                                            gloves. Then, immediately clean your hands with soap and water or
                                            alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Next, remove and dispose of facemask, and
                                            immediately clean your hands again with soap and water or alcohol-based hand
                                            sanitizer.


                                            Avoid sharing household items with the patient. You should not share dishes,
                                            drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, bedding, or other items.
                                            After the patient uses these items, you should wash them thoroughly (see
                                            below “Wash laundry thoroughly”).


                                            Clean all “high-touch” surfaces, such as counters, tabletops, doorknobs,
                                            bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables,

                                            urges people to use masks wisely.

                                            WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of
                                            precious resources and mis-use of masks ( Advice on the use of masks).

                                            The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are
                                            to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or
                                            tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who
                                            are coughing or sneezing. See basic protective measures against the new

                                            The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough.
                                            Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore
                                            throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.

                                            unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing
                                            special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes
                                            seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those

                                            During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work. Follow
                                            the steps below:

                                            Protect yourself and others.

                                            Stay home if you are sick. Keep away from people who are sick. Limit close
                                            contact with others as much as possible (about 6 feet).

                                            Put your household plan into action.

                                            Stay informed about the local COVID-19 situation. Be aware of temporary
                                            school dismissals in your area, as this may affect your household’s daily
                                            routine.

                                            Continue practicing everyday preventive actions. Cover coughs and sneezes
                                            with a tissue and wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20
                                            seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that
                                            contains 60% alcohol. Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects daily
                                            using a regular household detergent and water.

                                            Notify your workplace as soon as possible if your regular work schedule
                                            changes. Ask to work from home or take leave if you or someone in your
                                            household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your child’s school is
                                            dismissed temporarily. Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and
                                            respond to COVID-19.

                                            Stay in touch with others by phone or email. If you have a chronic medical
                                            condition and live alone, ask family, friends, and health care providers to
                                            check on you during an outbreak. Stay in touch with family and friends,
                                            especially those at increased risk of developing severe illness, such as
                                            older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions. </div>

                                            This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there
                                            does not seem to be a lot of illness in children. Most illness, including
                                            serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults. If
                                            there cases of COVID-19 that impact your child’s school, the school may
                                            dismiss students. Keep track of school dismissals in your community. Read or
                                            watch local media sources that report school dismissals. If schools are
                                            dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.

                                            If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare
                                            facility or school. Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and
                                            activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork.

                                            Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while
                                            school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community.

                                                refrigerated or frozen food?

                                            Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person
                                            through respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support
                                            transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating
                                            food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20
                                            seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after
                                            blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.

                                            It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or
                                            object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or
                                            possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus
                                            spreads.

                                            In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on
                                            surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or
                                            packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient,
                                            refrigerated, or frozen temperatures. </div>
